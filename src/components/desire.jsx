      <p>
        During Jesus’ earthly ministry, He asked His disciples, “What seek ye?”
        (John 1:38). On another occasion, after His resurrection in the
        Americas, He went to his other disciples, and one by one asked them
        individually, “What is it that ye desire of me…?” (3 Nephi 28).{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        If Jesus appeared to me, and ask me what I desire/want from Him, I often
        wonder what I would ask. Would I ask Him for something that is in line
        with His will? Or would it be temporal and fleeting?
      </p>

      <p>
        In Luke 11: 9-10, Jesus said, "<strong>Ask</strong>, and it shall be
        given you; <strong>seek</strong>, and ye shall find;{" "}
        <strong>knock</strong>, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one
        that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
        knocketh it shall be opened. I believe that our Heavenly Father and
        Jesus Christ are very much involved in the things that I ask Them for.
