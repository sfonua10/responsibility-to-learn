      <h1>Invitation</h1>

      <p>
        The Savior invited a rich young ruler who wanted to inherit eternal life
        to, “Come, follow me”. I imagine Him offering this same invitation to
        me, someone who desire Eternal Life as well. The word “come” is defined
        as “move or travel toward or into a place thought of as near or familiar
        to the speaker”. I interpret this to mean, leaving (forsaking) how I
        live now and be in a place that truly emulates a Christlike life.

        Some practical ways of what I'm talking about is doing the things that
        He has done, and go where He goes. He was baptized. To be follow Him,
        therefore, I need to be baptized in the way and manner he was baptized.
        Jesus fasted. I need to fast. He ministered to others. I need to
        minister to others. He healed the sick. I can heal the sick by providing
        medicine, blessings, advice to recovery, etc. Jesus forgave. I follow
        Him by forgiving others.

        President Thomas S. Monson has said: "physically walking where Jesus
        walked is less important than walking as He walked. Emulating His
        actions and following His example are far more important than trying to
        retrace the remnants of the trails He traversed in mortality." (Oct
        2014)

        The Rich young ruler asked Jesus, “Good Master, what good thing shall I
        do, that I may have eternal life? King Laman, asked Aaron, “What shall I
        do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Both of
        these individuals sought eternal life. However, the rich young ruler was
        humble enough to ask the Lord what he lacked, but not faithful enough to
        follow the divine counsel the Lord had given him.
      </p>

      <p>
        King Laman on the other hand, declared to Aaron that he would give up
        all his possessions, even his kingdom to receive the joy that comes from
        knowing God. Soon after in prayer to God, he told the God that he would
        give up all his sins to know Him. The King was converted.
